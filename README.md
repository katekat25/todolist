Bro I straight up gave up here hahaha. The app works as intended but does not have localStorage implemented. I tried to make it work and thus understand how to serialize and deserialize objects a little bit, but I've just been looking at this project for like two weeks now and I just want it done tbh. I may come back to it and add different functionality. For now, here ya go.
