# todolist

I was this close to giving up on the project without adding local storage, can you believe it? I wrote a sad README.txt and everything! But somehow I managed to make it all work and I'm feeling very proud of myself. This probably took me at least 20 hours, which is much more than I had expected. I feel that I've learned a lot from this project and have more or less solidified a lot of my skills. If I were to go back to it, I would definitely add a sorting feature that sorts todo items by due date and priority, which wouldn't be so difficult to implement. I would also make it so that completed tasks are sent to the bottom of the list. But, everything I really wanted to implement is now complete, and I am more or less satisfied. Thanks for taking a look!
